UWP Dodge game project
This game is my first UWP project in my fullstack developmemt course
inspired by :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvBkoAl_KM8 

Overview : 

This game is less off knowledge based but more of explanatory based project
I tried to make absract classes to manage the app and a nice UI for the playert to actuly have fun.
As you may see the game has Slim-Shady themed music and images.


My game has one Board class for game's logic in , 3 more for gamePieces and one i copied from StackOverflaw for vitualKeyPressing (Yes i know how to google stuff).
I made a simple Dodge game where user plays with keyboard Up , Down , Right , Left ,(== WSDA) and R==Restart P== Pause space== Change hero.
The GamePiece is a two classes father for UserPiece and EnemyPiece which being builed by the Board Obj

In MaimXaml.cs i categorize them to Start game methods Manage game methods  and UI Methods to make the code clear and understanable.

In conclution the game aims to use inheritance idea and abstract classes whom i can use in other GUI technoligies in the future and try excercise managing desktop app flow.

If you come across you may leave you impression on my project.
